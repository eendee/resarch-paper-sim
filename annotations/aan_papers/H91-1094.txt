PROJECT GOALS 
To investigate a theory of message and 
discourse understanding based on the building of 
explanatory causal models and the nested beliefs 
of discourse agents, so as to construct robust sys- 
tems for message understanding with wider 
application to machine translation and text 
retrieval. 
APPROACH 
We view the task of the robust understand- 
ing of messages from texts and discourse as the 
use of extraction of gists from a noisy back- 
ground by using techniques of (a) the recursive 
computation of agent's points of view of each 
others' environments, beliefs, expertise tc. and 
(b) representations of those beliefs and expertise 
as networks which are obtained by "best-fit" 
methods against stored knowledge structures. We 
implement these high-level assumptions by 
means of different ypes of parsers (some more 
syntactic, others more semantic) and the choice 
between these we see as purely empirical, based 
on our evaluation methodology. At present we 
are concentrating on PREMO-II, a semantics 
based parser which does contain some syntactic 
rules, but which can be weighted based on sta- 
tistical surveys of Navy message t xts. 
RECENT WORK 
We have continued o work within the 
Navy message domain with this project since we 
were late starters and wanted to get some results 
before switching over to new domains and text 
types (see below). We have succeeded in 
integrating the ViewGen belief manipulation 
system with the conceptual graph + MGR 
knowledge representation, soas to provide a sin- 
gle system that can both guide the message 
parsers and represent he results of message 
extraction. 
This rich representation has, in turn, been 
linked to the PREMO-II semantics-based parser 
that parses Navy messages on the bases of 
preferences, anticipated metonymies closely 
linked to preferences (e.g.CONTACT WENT 
SINKER), and the weighting of simple syntactic 
rules based on statistics of a large sample of such 
messages. This type of method, although derived 
for general text has proved very suitable for "sys- 
tematically ungrammatical" text like the Navy 
messages. 
We have begun to investigate how to 
expand these techniques to a different ext type, 
the longer terrorist messages, in conjunction with 
the set of techniques we have proposed for the 
TIPSTER extraction program. 
Some of our effort under this contract has 
been diverted to getting the ACL Consortium for 
Lexical Research up and running before its 
official DARPA funding date of March 1st. 
PLANS FOR THE COMING YEAR 
We expect to take the shell of the 
PREMO-H method and provide it with a new 
data-base of lexical entries, partly automatically 
derived from existing machine readable dic- 
tionaries and partly tuned against large text 
data-bases. Our standards of content in the lexi- 
cal entries for parsing will be those of the 
Pustejovsky and Annick work at Brandeis 
University, with whom we expect o collaborate. 
The method will also be integrated with surface 
demons for categories like proper names, country 
and place names, company names, etc. that have 
been derived separately by David MacDonald. 
These methods will give, we believe, a general 
and robust method of extraction from documents 
on a large scale.
