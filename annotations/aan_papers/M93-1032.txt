This topic session focussed on a variety of issues in evaluation (three presentations) and extraction (on e
presentation) . For the extraction presentation, Tsuyoshi Kitani, a visiting researcher at the Center fo r
Machine Translation at Carnegie-Mellon University gave a presention entitled "Overview of TEXTRAC T
Template-Filling Solutions" . This talk gave an overview of TEXTRACT, which processes articles in th e
Japanese joint venture and microelectronics domains . Although TEXTRACT was developed at C1bIU a s
an optional system of the GE-CMU SHOGUN system, the systems share no code beyond the MAJEST Y
morphological analyzer, and some of the knowledge in TEXTRACT was used to develop SHOGUN .
TEXTRACT is comprised of four major components: preprocessing, pattern matching, discourse pro-
cessing, and template generating . A method of identifying company names was discussed, as the correct ,
identification of company names is key to achieving a high performance level under the template structure o f
the joint venture domain . The discourse processing, which merges individual pieces of information identified
by the sentence level pattern matcher, was also described .
Nancy Chinchor, SAIC, talked about "Balancing the elements of evaluation" . The successful evaluatio n
of systems requires the balancing of elements of the evaluation . She defined the elements of evaluation ,
the opposing forces within each element and between elements, and methods used to resolve these opposing
forces . The dangers of not balancing the elements individually and altogether were pointed out . Her reflectio n
on the evaluation offered unmathematical measures of our success and thoughts for future endeavors .
Jerry Hobbs, SRI International, in his talk "In Defense of Recall and Precision" gave some excellen t
arguments why the older measures of recall and precision were more appropriate for data extraction system s
than the newer error rate . First he defined how information extraction sets up a correspondence between th e
world or text and facts within it, and a database and the items in the database . With this correspondence ,
recall naturally corresponds to the question "for every fact in the world/text, is there a corresponding ite m
in the database?" . Similarly, precision answers the question "for every item in the database, is there a
corresponding fact in the world/text? " . Recall and precision have natural correspondences to both th e
development cycle and the user's environment . In the development cycle, examining the corpus to determin e
how to modify the system increases recall . Testing the system on the corpus to put constraints on the syste m
increases precision . In the user's environment, low recall can be fixed by increasing the redundancy of th e
corpus, and low precision can be improved by adding a user in the system processing loop . Moreover, the
F-measure exhibits the desirable properties of being highest when both recall and precision are high . Jerry
went on to claim that error rate is an appropriate evaluation measure when there is a one-to-one mappin g
between "key" and "response", as in speech recognition, but that with data extraction, where there ar e
multiple possible fills for some slots, the measure is not appropriate . However there the differences betwee n
the two measures are so small that at least for MUC-5, error rate is identical to the F-measure .
Finally, Lisa Rau, GE R&D, noted the importance of defining requirements in advance, and as a n
integrated team including funding agencies, end users, evaluators and contractors to prevent wasted time an d
money in system redesign . Also, the implications of the template design on the system design were addressed .
The frequency of occurrence of each slot, how easy or hard each slot is to fill and the interdependencies amon g
slots all have an influence system design and should be addressed during the template design phase . It was
noted that the differences in scores caused by changes in the algorithms used in the scoring program wer e
dwarfed by differences in score attributable to the template design, such as default fills, the interpretation o f
the "correct answer" and the decision to copy objects in sentences such as "This process is similar to that use d
in France, Germany and Japan ." . Finally, there was a discussion about the tradeoff between realistic task s
that require large amounts of non-language processing system engineering (such as TIPSTER), and simple r
tasks that might take less system engineering and push research in natural language text interpretation more .
