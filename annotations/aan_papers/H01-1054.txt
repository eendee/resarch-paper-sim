ABSTRACT 
We present and evaluate the initial version of RIPTIDES, a 
system that combines information extraction, extraction-based 
summarization, and natural language generation to support user-
directed multidocument summarization. 
1. INTRODUCTION 
Although recent years has seen increased and successful research 
efforts in the areas of single-document summarization, 
multidocument summarization, and information extraction, very 
few investigations have explored the potential of merging 
summarization and information extraction techniques.  This paper 
presents and evaluates the initial version of RIPTIDES, a system 
that combines information extraction (IE), extraction-based 
summarization, and natural language generation to support user-
directed multidocument summarization.  (RIPTIDES stands for 
RapIdly Portable Translingual Information extraction and 
interactive multiDocumEnt Summarization.)  Following [10], we 
hypothesize that IE-supported summarization will enable the 
generation of more accurate and targeted summaries in specific 
domains than is possible with current domain-independent 
techniques.  
In the sections below, we describe the initial implementation and 
evaluation of the RIPTIDES IE-supported summarization system.  
We conclude with a brief discussion of related and ongoing work. 
2. SYSTEM DESIGN 
Figure 1 depicts the IE-supported summarization system. The 
system first requires that the user select (1) a set of documents in 
which to search for information, and (2) one or more scenario 
templates (extraction domains) to activate. The user optionally 
provides filters and preferences on the scenario template slots, 
specifying what information s/he wants to be reported in the 
summary. RIPTIDES next applies its Information Extraction 
subsystem to generate a database of extracted events for the 
selected domain and then invokes the Summarizer to generate a 
natural language summary of the extracted information subject to 
the user?s constraints. In the subsections below, we describe the 
IE system and the Summarizer in turn. 
2.1 IE System 
The domain for the initial IE-supported summarization system and 
its evaluation is natural disasters.  Very briefly, a top-level natural 
disasters scenario template contains: document-level information 
(e.g. docno, date-time); zero or more agent elements denoting 
each person, group, and organization in the text; and zero or 
more disaster elements.  Agent elements encode standard 
information for named entities (e.g. name, position, geo-political 
unit).  For the most part, disaster elements also contain standard 
event-related fields (e.g. type, number, date, time, location, 
damage sub-elements).  
The final product of the RIPTIDES system, however, is not a set 
of scenario templates, but a user-directed multidocument 
summary.  This difference in goals influences a number of 
template design issues.  First, disaster elements must distinguish 
different reports or views of the same event from multiple sources.  
As a result, the system creates a separate disaster event for each 
such account.  Disaster elements should also include the reporting 
agent, date, time, and location whenever possible.  In addition, 
damage elements (i.e. human and physical effects) are best 
grouped according to the reporting event.  Finally, a slight 
broadening of the IE task was necessary in that extracted text was 
not constrained to noun phrases.  In particular, adjectival and 
adverbial phrases that encode reporter confidence, and sentences 
and clauses denoting relief effort progress appear beneficial for 
creating informed summaries.  Figure 2 shows the scenario 
template for one of 25 texts tracking the 1998 earthquake in 
Afghanistan (TDT2 Topic 89).  The texts were also manually 
annotated for noun phrase coreference; any phrase involved in a 
coreference relation appears underlined in the running text. 
The RIPTIDES system for the most part employs a traditional IE 
architecture [4].  In addition, we use an in-house implementation 
of the TIPSTER architecture [8] to manage all linguistic 
annotations.  A preprocessor first finds sentences and tokens.  For 
syntactic analysis, we currently use the Charniak [5] parser, which 
creates Penn Treebank-style parses [9] rather than the partial 
parses used in most IE systems.  Output from the parser is 
converted automatically into TIPSTER parse and part-of-speech 
annotations, which are added to the set of linguistic annotations 
for the document.  The extraction phase of the system identifies 
domain-specific relations among relevant entities in the text.  It 
relies on Autoslog-XML, an XSLT implementation of the 
Autoslog-TS system [12], to acquire extraction patterns.  
Autoslog-XML is a weakly supervised learning system that 
requires two sets of texts for training ? one set comprises texts 
relevant to the domain of interest and the other, texts not relevant 
 
 
 
to the domain.  Based on these and a small set of extraction 
pattern templates, the system finds a ranked list of possible 
extraction patterns, which a user then annotates with the 
appropriate extraction label (e.g. victim). Once acquired, the 
patterns are applied to new documents to extract slot fillers for the 
domain.  Selectional restrictions on allowable slot fillers are 
implemented using WordNet [6] and BBN?s Identifinder [3] 
named entity component.  In the current version of the system, no 
coreference resolution is attempted; instead, we rely on a very 
simple set of heuristics to guide the creation of output templates.  
The disaster scenario templates extracted for each text are 
provided as input to the summarization component along with all 
linguistic annotations accrued in the IE phase.  No relief slots are 
included in the output at present, since there was insufficient 
annotated data to train a reliable sentence categorizer. 
2.2 The Summarizer 
In order to include relief and other potentially relevant 
information not currently found in the scenario templates, the 
Summarizer extracts selected sentences from the input articles and 
adds them to the summaries generated from the scenario 
templates.  The extracted sentences are listed under the heading 
Selected News Excerpts, as shown in the two sample summaries 
appearing in Figures 3 and 4, and discussed further in Section 
2.2.5 below. 
2.2.1 Summarization Stages 
The Summarizer produces each summary in three main stages.  In 
the first stage, the output templates are merged into an event-
oriented structure, while keeping track of source information.  The 
merge operation currently relies on simple heuristics to group 
extracted facts that are comparable; for example, during this phase 
damage reports are grouped according to whether they pertain to 
the event as a whole, or instead to damage in the same particular 
location.  Heuristics are also used in this stage to determine the 
most relevant damage reports, taking into account specificity, 
recency and news source.  Towards the same objective but using a 
more surface-oriented means, simple word-overlap clustering is 
used to group sentences from different documents into clusters 
that are likely to report similar content.  In the second stage, a 
base importance score is first assigned to each slot/sentence based 
on a combination of document position, document recency and 
group/cluster membership.  The base importance scores are then 
adjusted according to user-specified preferences and matching 
scenario

criteria.  The adjusted scores are used to select the most important 
slots/sentences to include in the summary, subject to the user-
specified word limit.  In the third and final stage, the summary is 
generated from the resulting content pool using a combination of 
top-down, schema-like text building rules and surface-oriented 
revisions.  The extracted sentences are simply listed in document 
order, grouped into blocks of adjacent sentences. 
2.2.2 Specificity of Numeric Estimates 
In order to intelligently merge and summarize scenario templates, 
we found it necessary to explicitly handle numeric estimates of 
varying specificity.  While we did find specific numbers (such as 
3,000) in some damage estimates, we also found cases with no 
number phrase at all (e.g. entire villages).  In between these 
extremes, we found vague estimates (thousands) and ranges of 
numbers (anywhere from 2,000 to 5,000).  We also found phrases 
that cannot be easily compared (more than half the region?s 
residents). 
To merge related damage information, we first calculate the 
numeric specificity of the estimate as one of the values NONE, 
VAGUE, RANGE, SPECIFIC, or INCOMPARABLE, based on the presence 
of a small set of trigger words and phrases (e.g. several, as many 
as, from ? to).  Next, we identify the most specific current 
estimates by news source, where a later estimate is considered to 
update an earlier estimate if it is at least as specific.  Finally, we 
determine two types of derived information units, namely (1) the 
minimum and maximum estimates across the news sources, and 
(2) any intermediate estimates that are lower than the maximum 
estimate.1   
In the content determination stage, scores are assigned to the 
derived information units based on the maximum score of the 
underlying units.  In the summary generation stage, a handful of 
text planning rules are used to organize the text for these derived 
units, highlighting agreement and disagreement across sources. 
2.2.3 Improving the Coherence of Extracted 
Sentences 
In our initial attempt to include extracted sentences, we simply 
chose the top ranking sentences that would fit within the word 
limit, subject to the constraint that no more than one sentence per 
cluster could be chosen, in order to help avoid redundancy.  We 
found that this approach often yielded summaries with very poor 
coherence, as many of the included sentences were difficult to 
make sense of in isolation.   
To improve the coherence of the extracted sentences, we have 
experimented with trying to boost coherence by favoring 
sentences in the context of the highest-ranking sentences over 
those with lower ranking scores, following the hypothesis that it is 
better to cover fewer topics in more depth than to change topics 
excessively.  In particular, we assign a score to a set of sentences 
by summing the base scores plus increasing coherence boosts for 
adjacent sentences, sentences that precede ones with an initial

 Less specific estimates such as ?hundreds? are considered lower 
than more specific numbers such as ?5000? when they are lower 
by more than a factor of 10.

A earthquake struck quake-devastated villages in northern 
Afghanistan Saturday. The earthquake had a magnitude of 6.9 
on the Richter scale on the Richter scale. 
Damage 
Estimates of the death toll varied. CNN (06/02/1998) provided 
the highest estimate of 4,000 dead, whereas ABC 
(06/01/1998) gave the lowest estimate of 140 dead.

Selected News Excerpts 
CNN (06/01/98):  
Thousands are dead and thousands more are still missing. Red 
cross officials say the first priority is the injured. Getting 
medicine to them is difficult due to the remoteness of the 
villages affected by the quake.  
PRI (06/01/98):  
We spoke to the head of the international red cross there, Bob 
McCaro on a satellite phone link. He says it?s difficult to 
know the full extent of the damage because the region is so 
remote. There?s very little infrastructure.  
PRI (06/01/98):  
Bob McCaro is the head of the international red cross in the 
neighboring country of Pakistan. He?s been speaking to us 
from there on the line.

pronoun, and sentences that preceded ones with strongly 
connecting discourse markers such as however, nevertheless, etc.  
We have also softened the constraint on multiple sampling from 
the same cluster, making use of a redundancy penalty in such 
cases.  We then perform a randomized local search for a good set 
of sentences according to these scoring criteria.  
2.2.4 Implementation 
The Summarizer is implemented using the Apache 
implementation of XSLT [1] and CoGenTex?s Exemplars 
Framework [13].  The Apache XSLT implementation has 
provided a convenient way to rapidly develop a prototype 
implementation of the first two processing stages using a series of 
XML transformations.  In the first step of the third summary 
generation stage, the text building component of the Exemplars 
Framework constructs a ?rough draft? of the summary text.  In 
this rough draft version, XML markup is used to partially encode 
the rhetorical, referential, semantic and morpho-syntactic structure 
of the text.  In the second generation step, the Exemplars text 
polishing component makes use of this markup to trigger surface-

country and had a magnitude of 6.9 on the Richter scale. 
Damage 
Estimates of the death toll varied. VOA (06/02/1998) 
provided the highest estimate of 5,000 dead. CNN 
(05/31/1998) and CNN (06/02/1998) supplied lower estimates 
of 3,000 and up to 4,000 dead, whereas APW (06/02/1998) 
gave the lowest estimate of anywhere from 2,000 to 5,000 
dead. People were injured, while thousands more were 
missing. Thousands were homeless. 
Quake-devastated villages were damaged. Estimates of the 
number of villages destroyed varied. CNN (05/31/1998) 
provided the highest estimate of 50 destroyed, whereas VOA 
(06/04/1998) gave the lowest estimate of at least 25 destroyed. 
In Afghanistan, thousands of people were killed.

form.  A distinguishing feature of our text polishing approach is 
the use of a bootstrapping tool to partially automate the 
acquisition of application-specific revision rules from examples. 
2.2.5 Sample Summaries 
Figures 3 and 4 show two sample summaries that were included in 
our evaluation (see Section 3 for details).  The summary in Figure 
3 was generated from simulated output of the IE system, with 
preference given to damage information; the summary in Figure 4 
was generated from the actual output of the current IE system, 
with preference given to information including the words Red 
Cross.   
While the summary in Figure 3 does a reasonable job of reporting 
the various current estimates of the death toll, the estimates of the 
death toll shown in Figure 4 are less accurate, because the IE 
system failed to extract some reports, and the Summarizer failed 
to correctly merge others.  In particular, note that the lowest 
estimate of 140 dead attributed to ABC is actually a report about 
the number of school children killed in a particular town.  Since 
no location was given for this estimate by the IE system, the 
Summarizer?s simple heuristic for localized damaged reports ? 
namely, to consider a damage report to be localized if a location is 
given that is not in the same sentence as the initial disaster 
description ? did not work here.  The summary in Figure 3 also 
suffered from some problems with merging:  the inclusion of a 
paragraph about thousands killed in Afghanistan is due to an 
incorrect classification of this report as a localized one (owing to 
an error in sentence boundary detection), and the discussion of the 
number of villages damaged should have included a report of at 
least 80 towns or villages damaged. 
Besides the problems related to slot extraction and merging 
mentioned above, the summaries shown in Figures 3 and 4 suffer 
from relatively poor fluency.  In particular, the summaries could 
benefit from better use of descriptive terms from the original 
articles, as well as better methods of sentence combination and 
rhetorical structuring.  Nevertheless, as will be discussed further 
in Section 4, we suggest that the summaries show the potential for 
our techniques to intelligently combine information from many 
articles on the same natural disaster. 
3. EVALUATION AND INITIAL RESULTS 
To evaluate the initial version of the IE-supported summarization 
system, we used Topic 89 from the TDT2 collection ? 25 texts 
on the 1998 Afghanistan earthquake. Each document was 
annotated manually with the natural disaster scenario templates 
that comprise the desired output of the IE system. In addition, 
treebank-style syntactic structure annotations were added 
automatically using the Charniak parser.  Finally, MUC-style 
noun phrase coreference annotations were supplied manually.  All 
annotations are in XML.  The manual and automatic annotations 
were automatically merged, leading to inaccurate annotation 
extents in some cases.  
Next, the Topic 89 texts were split into a development corpus and 
a test corpus.  The development corpus was used to build the 
summarization system; the evaluation summaries were generated 
from the test corpus.  We report on three different variants of the 
RIPTIDES system here: in the first variant (RIPTIDES-SIM1), an 
earlier version of the Summarizer uses the simulated output of the 
IE system as its input, including the relief annotations; in the 
second variant (RIPTIDES-SIM2), the current version of the 
Summarizer uses the simulated output of the IE system, without 
the relief annotations; and in the third variant (RIPTIDES-IE), the 
Summarizer uses the actual output of the IE system as its input.2   
Summaries generated by the RIPTIDES variants were compared 
to a Baseline system consisting of a simple, sentence-extraction 
multidocument summarizer relying only on document position, 
recency, and word overlap clustering.  (As explained in the 
previous section, we have found that word overlap clustering 
provides a bare bones way to help determine what information is 
repeated in multiple articles, thereby indicating importance to the 
document set as a whole, as well as to help reduce redundancy in 
the resulting summaries.)  In addition, the RIPTIDES and 
Baseline system summaries were compared against the summaries 
of two human authors.  All of the summaries were graded with 
respect to content, organization, and readability on an A-F scale 
by three graduate students, all of whom were unfamiliar with this 
project.  Note that the grades for RIPTIDES-SIM1, the Baseline 
system, and the two human authors were assigned during a first 
evaluation in October, 2000, whereas the grades for RIPTIDES-
SIM2 and RIPTIDES-IE were assigned by the same graders in an 
update to this evaluation in April, 2001. 
Each system and author was asked to generate four summaries of 
different lengths and emphases: (1) a 100-word summary of the 
May 30 and May 31 articles; (2) a 400-word summary of all test 
articles, emphasizing specific, factual information; (3) a 200-word 
summary of all test articles, focusing on the damage caused by the 
quake, and excluding information about relief efforts, and (4) a 
200-word summary of all test articles, focusing on the relief 
efforts, and highlighting the Red Cross?s role in these efforts.  
The results are shown in Tables 1 and 2.  Table 1 provides the 
overall grade for each system or author averaged across all graders 
and summaries, where each assigned grade has first been 
converted to a number (with A=4.0 and F=0.0) and the average 
converted back to a letter grade.  Table 2 shows the mean and 
standard deviations of the overall, content, organization, and 
readability scores for the RIPTIDES and the Baseline systems 
averaged across all graders and summaries.  Where the differences 
vs. the Baseline system are significant according to the t-test, the 
p-values are shown. 
Given the amount of development effort that has gone into the 
system to date, we were not surprised that the RIPTIDES variants 
fared poorly when compared against the manually written 
summaries, with RIPTIDES-SIM2 receiving an average grade of 
C, vs. A- and B+ for the human authors.  Nevertheless, we were 
pleased to find that RIPTIDES-SIM2 scored a full grade ahead of 
the Baseline summarizer, which received a D, and that

 Note that since the summarizers for the second and third variants 
did not have access to the relief sentence categorizations, we 
decided to exclude from their input the two articles (one 
training, one test) classified by TDT2 Topic 89 as only 
containing brief mentions of the event of interest, as otherwise 
they would have no means of excluding the largely irrelevant 
material in these documents. 
RIPTIDES-IE managed a slightly higher grade of D+, despite the 
immature state of the IE system.  As Table 2 shows, the 
differences in the overall scores were significant for all three 
RIPTIDES variants, as were the scores for organization and 
readability, though not for content in the cases of RIPTIDES-
SIM1 and RIPTIDES-IE. 
4. RELATED AND ONGOING WORK 
The RIPTIDES system is most similar to the SUMMONS system 
of Radev and McKeown [10], which summarized the results of 
MUC-4 IE systems in the terrorism domain.  As a pioneering 
effort, the SUMMONS system was the first to suggest the 
potential of combining IE with NLG in a summarization system, 
though no evaluation was performed.  In comparison to 
SUMMONS, RIPTIDES appears to be designed to more 
completely summarize larger input document sets, since it focuses 
more on finding the most relevant current information, and since 
it includes extracted sentences to round out the summaries.  
Another important difference is that SUMMONS sidestepped the 
problem of comparing reported numbers of varying specificity 
(e.g. several thousand vs. anywhere from 2000 to 5000 vs. up to 
4000 vs. 5000), whereas we have implemented rules for doing so.  
Finally, we have begun to address some of the difficult issues that 
arise in merging information from multiple documents into a 
coherent event-oriented view, though considerable challenges 
remain to be addressed in this area. 
The sentence extraction part of the RIPTIDES system is similar to 
the domain-independent multidocument summarizers of Goldstein 
et al [7] and Radev et al [11] in the way it clusters sentences 
across documents to help determine which sentences are central to 
the collection, as well as to reduce redundancy amongst sentences 
included in the summary.  It is simpler than these systems insofar 
as it does not make use of comparisons to the centroid of the 
document set.  As pointed out in [2], it is difficult in general for 
multidocument summarizers to produce coherent summaries, 
since it is less straightforward to rely on the order of sentences in 
the underlying documents than in the case of single-document 
summarization.  Having also noted this problem, we have focused 
our efforts in this area on attempting to balance coherence and 
informativeness in selecting sets of sentences to include in the 
summary. 
In ongoing work, we are investigating techniques for improving 
merging accuracy and summary fluency in the context of 
summarizing the more than 150 news articles we have collected 
from the web about each of the recent earthquakes in Central 
America and India (January, 2001).  We also plan to investigate 
using tables and hypertext drill-down as a means to help the user 
verify the accuracy of the summarized information. 
By perusing the web collections mentioned above, we can see that 
trying to manually extricate the latest damage estimates from 150+ 
news articles from multiple sources on the same natural disaster 
would be very tedious.  Although estimates do usually converge, 
they often change rapidly at first, and then are gradually dropped 
from later articles, and thus simply looking at the latest article is 
not satisfactory.  While significant challenges remain, we suggest 
that our initial system development and evaluation shows that our 
approach has the potential to accurately summarize damage 
estimates, as well as identify other key story items using shallower 
techniques, and thereby help alleviate information overload in 
specific domains.
