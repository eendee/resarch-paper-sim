Introduction 
NYU supported the TIPSTER Phase II effort in the 
development of the TIPSTER Architecture, with 
enhancements to both their Detection and Extraction 
systems, and with experiments in the combined use 
of Extraction and Detection for document retrieval. 
Architecture Effort 
Dr. Ralph Grishman steered the Architecture Working 
Group, and led its subset, the Contractors' 
Architecture Working Group (CAWG), in the 
development of the Architecture Design and the 
implementation f that design in the two Architecture 
demonstrations, the first shown at the TIPSTER 
Phase II 6-Month Workshop in November 1994, and 
the second at the 12-Month Workshop in May 1995. 
He continues to lead these two groups through the 
period of revisions to the Architecture as a result of 
its use in TIPSTER demonstration projects and 
elsewhere. 
Enhancements to Extraction 
NYU's Proteus extraction system was modified to use 
combined syntactic and semantic pattern based 
methods. The results were demonstrated in MUC-6, 
where the modified system achieved excellent results, 
particularly in the Coreference Task. The results of 
this work, which incorporates much that has been 
learned from other TIPSTER participants using this 
method, increase our understanding of the role of 
syntax in Information Extraction and will be used to 
further our progress toward the goal of an extraction 
system which can be configured for a task by the 
user.

Enhancements to Detection 
TIPSTER Detection research at NYU has been guided 
by Dr. Tomek Strzalkowski, who began at NYU, but 
moved to GE Corporate Research and Development in 
January 1995. NYU uses a modified version of 
NIST's Prise engine in its experiments. The NYU 
system has been modified to be TIPSTER 
Architecture compliant and has participated in TREC- 
3 and TREC-4 under the TIPSTER contract. TREC 
Performance of this system, which uses a NLP 
module to enhance the Prise statistical core, has 
steadily improved, not only measured against itself, 
but in relation to other participating systems. The 
NLP module is used to identify appropriate multi- 
word phrases for use in indexing and in processing the 
user's natural language search requests. 
Experiments in Combined Detection 
and Extraction 
In the final six months of TIPSTER Phase II, the 
combined NYU system, using the TIPSTER 
Architecture to enable integration of the Detection and 
Extraction systems, will be used to experiment with 
ways of using Extraction to improve Detection. This 
work will be focussed on improving the user's ability 
to identify news articles which contain information 
such as: what a certain person has said about a certain 
topic, who of significance has travelled to specific 
places, who has specified kinds of relationships with 
certain kinds of companies. TREC data will be used 
in these experiments. One goal of the experiments is 
to contribute to the on-going TIPSTER work in the 
use of combined Detection and Extraction systems. 
Another goal is to understand better what our users 
need from their retrieval systems and demonstrate an 
ability to provide retrieval improvements which are 
meaningful to them.
