PROJECT GOALS 
This year, project efforts are focused on reapplying and 
revising existing evaluation techniques for the purpose of 
evaluating English and Japanese information extraction 
systems in the joint ventures and microelectronics 
domains. This year's effort will culminate in the Fifth 
Message Understanding Conference (MUC-5) in August, 
1993. 
development in March, 1993, in preparation for the 
evaluation i July and the conference in August. Over 
20 organizations (including Tipster-sponsored 
organizations) are planning to participate. Most of the 
non-Tipster organizations will be working only on the 
English joint ventures task or the English 
microelectronics task; however, two will be working on 
joint ventures in both languages, and one will be 
working on microelectronics in Japanese only. 
RECENT RESULTS 
MUC-4: The MUC-4 evaluation was conducted in 
FY92, the conference was held in June, 1992, and a 
proceedings was published in September. A single-value 
metric based on recall and precision was developed, and 
statistical significance tests were conducted. A blind test 
of 17 seventeen systems was conducted using an 
improved version of the Latin American terrorism 
information extraction task originally defined for MUC- 
3. Higher levels of performance by nearly all veteran 
systems were achieved for MUC-4, but the top scores are 
still only moderate. Progress in controlling the tendency 
to generate spurious data was obvious, but the problem 
still exists, along with the problem of insufficient 
domain coverage and general world knowledge. The push 
to extend the systems has brought into the focus the 
adverse effect that errors made in early stages of 
processing at the sentence and phrasal evel have on 
suprasentential processing done in subsequent stages. 
TIPSTER INTERIM EVALUATIONS: The 
scoring software used for MUC-4 was rewritten for the 
object-oriented Tipster template design. Accomodations 
were made for scoring Japanese. Alternative scoring 
procedures and new metrics were introduced. The Tipster 
English and Japanese systems were evaluated in 
September, 1992 on joint ventures, and they were 
evaluated in February, 1993 on both joint ventures and 
microelectronics. The results of these evaluations are 
being used to make decisions concerning the evaluation 
methodology tobe used for the final Tipster evaluation 
(which will be the MUC-5 evaluation). 
MUC-5: The call for participation i  MUC-5 was 
issued in October, 1992, and participants began 
PLANS FOR THE YEAR 
? Improve the evaluation methodology to be 
used for MUC-5 based on the experiences of the Tipster 
interim evaluations. 
? Coordinate the MUC-5 evaluation and 
conduct the conference. 
? Foster interest in resource-sharing among 
evaluation participants to support future R&D on 
information extraction and NLP in general.
