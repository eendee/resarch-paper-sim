PROJECT GOALS 
The Naval Ocean Systems Center is extending 
the scope of previous efforts in the area of 
evaluating English text analysis systems and is 
seeking to refine the methodology in order to 
obtain performance benchmarks on an 
information extraction task for recall, 
precision, overgeneration, and fallout for a 
variety of systems. The methodology is also 
intended to enable the collection of qualitative 
data on the relative validity of the text analysis 
techniques as applied to the task of information 
extraction. 
RECENT RESULTS 
The third evaluation began in October, 1990; a 
dry-run phase was completed in February, 
1991. Twelve sites reported results for the 
dry-run test at a meeting held on 13-15 
February, 1991. The test required extracting 
information on terrorist incidents (incident 
type, date, location, perpetrator, target, 
instrument, outcome, etc.) from relevant 
messages in a blind test on 100 previously 
unseen texts in the test set. The results of 
this test are summarized in a paper found 
elsewhere in this volume. 
PLANS FOR THE COMING YEAR 
Official testing will be done in May, 1991, and 
the Third Message Understanding Conference 
(MUC-3) will be held May 21-23 at the Naval 
Ocean Systems Center. A proceedings will be 
published on the basis of this conference. The 
results of the evaluation will be analyzed to 
discover whether conclusions can be drawn 
concerning the correlation among task 
performance, text analysis capabilities, and 
theoretical approach. 
In addition to the official measures, unofficial 
measures will be obtained of performance on 
part icular l inguist ic phenomena (e.g., 
conjunction), as measured by the information 
extracted in particular sets of instances. That 
is, text segments exemplifying a selected 
phenomenon will be marked for special scoring 
if successful handling of the phenomenon seems 
to be required in order to fill one or more 
template slots correctly for that segment.
