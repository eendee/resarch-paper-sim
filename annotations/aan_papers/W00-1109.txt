Abst ract  
This paper describes a system which en- 
ables users to create on-the-fly queries 
which involve not just keywords, but 
also sortal constraints and linguistic on- 
straints. The user can specify how the 
results should be presented e.g. in terms 
of links to documents, or as table en- 
tries. The aim is to bridge the gap be- 
tween keyword based Information Re- 
trieval and pattern based Information 
Extraction. 
1 In t roduct ion  
The amount of information available lectronically 
in a free-text format is ever increasing. People re- 
quire tools that give them the best possible answer 
to their queries even when a full answer may not 
be available. 
Current web Information Retrieval (IR) engines 
standardly retrieve URLs to whole documents, 
and typical user queries are just an unordered 
set of keywords. This is robust and allows un- 
restricted queries, but precision can be poor, and 
the output is not particularly convenient for many 
queries. For example, ff we are interested in e.g. 
companies associated with Mr. Jones, we are likely 
to prefer an output in terms of an alphabetically 
ordered list of companies (with links to the sen- 
tences in which they appear) rather than a list of 
URLs. 
Information Extraction (IE) systems pro- 
vide better presentation of results (e.g. tables, 
database records etc.), and tend to include more 
precise searches which depend upon not just find- 
ing keywords but finding them in particular posi- 
tions or in particular grammatical relationships. 
However, current IE systems typically require 
queries to be programmed beforehand, so are suit- 
able only for cases where the same query is to be 
used time and again e.g. in the processing of a 
newsfeed. 
Customisation ofan IE system involves two ma- 
jor tasks: 
? adapting the information extraction system 
to a new domain, e.g. adding vocabulary, new 
grammatical constructions and domain ontol- 
og:y. 
? creating new patterns for extraction in the 
new domain. 
Customising current IE systems is thus expensive. 
A domain expert and a linguist with knowledge of 
the IE system will generally be required to specify 
the task, manually mark-up or categorise domain 
data, perhaps build a domain ontology, write ex- 
traction patterns and fine-tune them for the best 
compromise of precision and recall. 
There are thus pressing reasons for automating 
the customisation task and reducing the involve- 
ment of linguists as much as possible. Several 
methods of automatically inferring patterns and 
semantic dictionaries from annotated texts have 
been suggested, e.g. (Riloff, 1993; Riloff, 1996; 
Sonderland et al, 1995; Yangarber and Grishman, 
1997). Pierce and Cardie (Cardie and Pierce, 
1998) suggest hat the use of annotated texts can 
be replaced by an interactive approach in which 
an end-user assists the system in bootstrapping 
patterns from a set of example results. However 
even this method is ill suited to one-off queries, 
where the user is unlikely to start from example 
results, but needs to be able to interactively home 
in on a set of answers. 
In this paper we describe a system which en- 
ables users to build advanced on-the-fly queries. 
The interface is intended to be intuitive for users 
already familiar with keyword IR but adds the ex- 
tra functionality of sortal, linguistic and positional 
constraints that are more common in IE. Adding 
extra linguistic onstraints may improve precision, 
and cause a drop in recall, in exactly the same way 
as adding an extra non-optional keyword. 
The approach is less ambitious than provid- 
ing full Natural Language querying, but allows 
85 
professional users of search technology (e.g. an- 
alysts or research scientists) to get most of the 
advantages of IE without having to program pat- 
terns. We assume that retraining of linguistic 
components ( uch as the tokeniser and tagger) for 
a new domain will still be performed by a lin- 
guist/programmer, and that end-users will be sup- 
plied with libraries of useful sorts such as person 
names, companies, locations, protein names etc. 
which are appropriate for their domain. 
2 IR  and  NLP  
Our key interest in this work was to provide a sys- 
tem which allowed users to get answers: not just 
documents or sub-documents. We have not ad- 
dressed the question of whether or not these tech- 
niques would also be useful for more traditional IR 
in the sense of finding the most relevant document 
for a particular query. There is some potential 
since there are extra options to refine or expand 
a query e.g. using sortal constraints such as com- 
pany and location, and restrictive constraints such 
as subject_of or same sentence. Since the linguis- 
tic constraints are under user control the query is 
more likely to be accurate than in systems where 
linguistic constraints are derived from a natural 
language query (though at the expense of usabil- 
ity). 
The system was designed to deal with multiple 
answer queries such as "which protein interacts 
with TAF-2?'.  This differs somewhat from the 
TREC question answering track ((TREC), 2000), 
where the emphasis is on questions which have 
a single answer, and systems attempt o provide 
the most relevant sub-document. To attempt he 
TREC task we would need to extend the sys- 
tem with a relevance weighting mechanism, and 
provide further techniques for query expansion. 
We would then expect the system to do well, 
since (Srihari and Li, 1999) show that the use of 
sortal constraints such as company, location and 
time plus constraints uch as same sentence give 
good results, even with a relatively simple ranking 
mechanism. 
How much extra cost is involved in using lin- 
guistic information? There is obviously some ini- 
tial cost in parsing and analysing the texts, how- 
ever this can largely be hidden by preprocessing 
the documents. In addition there is a space cost 
in having a much larger index: this is necessary 
since we are keeping more information about the 
document's structure. Finally, there is the cost of 
evaluating more complex constraints. The cost of 
using sortal constraints i negligible: we can index 
them in exactly the same way as words. However, 
i l :  P 
i2 :  a 
i3 :  b 
i4 : i1 ( i2 , i3 )  
Figure 1: Distributed representation f P(a, b) 
relational constraints such as same sentence do in- 
troduce extra processing. The figures we present 
at the end of this paper show that this first im- 
plementation of the system is fast enough to be 
usable for some real applications (and very fast 
by Information Extraction standards), but is not 
yet in the same league as standard IR engines. 
3 Highlight 
Highlight (Thomas et al, 2000) is a general- 
purpose IE engine for use in commercial appli- 
cations. The work described in the current pa- 
per extends Highlight by building an interface on 
top of it and replacing the internal representation 
of linguistically analysed texts with a representa- 
tion based on distributed representations c.f. (Mil- 
ward, 2000). Demos of the Highlight System are 
accessible from the SRI Cambridge web site at 
http://www.cam.sri.com 
3.1 Distributed Representation 
The inspiration for the approach taken here was 
the work in (Milward, 2000) on interpretation of 
dialogue utterances. This uses distributed seman- 
tic representations (based on indexing individual 
parts of a semantic structure) to encode both full 
and partial semantic analyses. For example, the 
logical form P(a,b) is represented by the set of 
constraints given in Figure 1. 
This approach aims to combine the advantages 
of shallow pattern-matching approaches (which 
are fast and robust) with those of deeper analysis 
which tends to do better for phenomena which in- 
volve scope. For example, consider the utterance 
"The 2.10 flight to Boston will not stop at New 
York". A simple pattern matching approach look- 
ing for \[flight 1 to \[location/via \[location\] would ex- 
tract the wrong information since it has no notion 
of the scope of the negation. 
In this work we take the same idea, but apply 
it to Information Extraction. Sets of indexed con- 
straints (which are themselves partial descriptions 
of semantic structure) are used directly as search 
expressions. Since the indexed constraints can en- 
code full semantic structures, the search terms can 
be more or less specific: we can start with just con- 
straints on lexical items, and then build up to a 
full semantic structure by adding structural con-

time(T) 
optional 
(I) K>H, H:M(N) 
(2) K:M(N) => departure_time(T) 
Figure 2: Extracting a departure time 
straints. 
Search is now a question of expressing the ap- 
propriate constraints on the information to be ex- 
tracted. For example, Figure 2 is a sketch rule 
to extract departure time from a sentence such 
as "I leave at 3pm." The rule subsumes a range 
of rules which vary in the specificity with which 
they apply. For example, applying only the oblig- 
atory conditions will result in the extraction of 
3pro as departure time from sentences such as "I 
leave Cambridge to arrive at 3pm" since in the 
obligatory component there is no restriction on 
M with respect o T, i.e. the leave event and the 
time. Adding the optional constraints in (1) gives 
us the restriction that the leaving must be domi- 
nated by the preposition at, e.g. "I leave from the 
station at 3pm," and (2) requires immediate domi- 
nance: "I leave at 3pm." This ranges from pattern 
matching to almost full semantics. Any particu- 
lar application of a rule can be scored according to 
the number of optional conditions which are ful- 
filled, thereby using linguistic constraints if they 
are available. 
In practice, the system described here departs 
from this approach in several respects. Firstly, we 
were working with the pre-existing Highlight sys- 
tem which uses shallow syntactic processing based 
on cascaded patterns (similar to (Hobbs et al, 
1996)). Deriving semantic relationships from this 
is not particularly reliable, so it is preferable to use 
search terms which rely more on positional clues. 
We therefore used a distributed syntactic repre- 
sentation to provide more reliable syntactic on- 
straints (e.g. head word of, subject of, same sen- 
tence) augmented by positional constraints (e.g. 
precedes, immediately precedes). Secondly, we 
wanted an intuitive user interface so constraints 
such as 'dominates' were not appropriate. 
3.2 User  In ter face 
Given the underlying representation described 
above, the user's task in building a query is to 
propose a set of constraints which can be matched 
against he representation f a text or set of texts. 
The interface attempts to preserve the conve- 
nience of keyword based IR but also enable more 
refined searches, and control over the presenta- 
tion of results. Keyword based search is a special 
case where the user specifies one or more keywords 
which they want to find in a document. However, 
users can also specify that they want to find a class 
of item (e.g. companies) and refine the search for 
items within the same sentence, not just the same 
document. 
For example, to find 'Esso' and a location in the 
same sentence we need the set of constraints given 
below: 
J : Esso  
location (T) 
same_sentence (J,T) 
The interface emphasises the items the user wants 
to search for. Consider Figure 3. The user is 
looking for two items, the first including the word 
Esso (this could be e.g. "Esso Corp.", "Esso Hold- 
ings" etc.), and the second item of sort 'location'. 
The effect of pressing ~Add' is to include the posi- 
tional constraint that the two items must appear 
in the same sentence. In later parts of this paper 
we provide examples of more sophisticated queries 
which imitate what is currently achieved by pat- 
tern matching in more standard IE systems (e.g. 
Fastus (Hobbs et al, 1996)). 
In our approach IE is a seamless extension of 
IR. This can be contrasted with some more typi- 
cal ways of tying together IE and IR by performing 
an IR search followed by IE. In that approach, l i t  
is used first to select a limited set of documents, 
then IE is applied. This is fine if the queries and 
the keywords are fixed (and appropriate for each 
other). It is not ideal otherwise. For example, 
suppose you are interested in Esso's profits. To 
achieve your query you might use IR to find doc- 
uments containing Esso, then use an IE system 
which has been customised to look for company 
profits. However, some of the results are likely 
to be unexpected, for example, you would obtain 
Shell's profits if there were a document describing 
Shell's profits which just happens to mention Esso 
in passing. 
Items can be constrained to have a particular 
head word, to include a particular word or to be of 
87

a particular sort. Multiple constraints on a single 
item are possible, as shown in Figure 5. Positional 
constraints can include any kind of inter-item con- 
straints e.g. precedes, same sentence. There are 
further option buttons which concern the files to 
be queried and the layout of the output. The de- 
fault is to provide a table which includes each item 
found plus the sentence in which it appears in the 
document. 
Two levels of user expertise (novice and expert) 
allow more or less control over the technical details 
of the query. Expert mode (accessed by clicking 
the button at the top right) looks much the same 
but has facilities such as altering the template out- 
put, naming the items and more options on the 
pull-down menus. For instance, in expert mode 
the user may specify which items are optional in 
the query, and what their syntactic lass might be. 
There are also additional extra parameters for the 
expert user for the output templates. 
A typical user query is given in Figure 4. Here 
the user is looking for appositives in the pat- 
tern Person Noun o.f Company, for example John 
Smith, chairman of X-Corp. 1 Note that the query 
is not particularly linguistically sophisticated: the 
Position item is glossed as a noun group and the 
single preposition of is specified when a looser re- 
striction (perhaps to be any preposition) would 
certainly turn up more results. However, this 
query is quick and simple to construct and can 
be used as a diagnostic for a more detailed query. 
A more complex query is shown in Figure 5 for 
a protein interaction task. The sort interaction 
in Figure 5 could be defined as a disjunction of 
the constraints head word = interact, head word 
= bind, head word = associate). 
3.3 One-o f f  Query  vs Pat tern  Base  
Highlight can operate in two distinct modes: in- 
teractive and batch. The interactive mode suits 
one-off queries as seen but can also be used to 
prototype queries on a subset of a corpus. Once 
a user is satisfied with the accuracy of a query, 
this user-defined 'pattern'  can be stored for later 
use. Batch mode is used when a query is to be 
run over a large amount of text and requires no 
intervention from the user other than the initial 
set-up. 
3.4 P reprocess ing  Fi les and  ScalabiHty 
If a user makes two queries over the same set of 
documents it does not make sense to do all the lin- 
guistic processing twice. To avoid this, documents 
1We currently do not index commas but a posi- 
tional constraint representing separation by a comma 
could easily be added. 
can be preprocessed. Preprocessing involves tag- 
ging, chunking, recognition of sorts, and conver- 
sion of the results into a set of constraints. At 
query time, there is no further linguistic process- 
ing to be done, just constraint satisfaction. 
The system has a relatively simple outer loop 
which considers a query for each document in turn 
(rather than e.g. using a single cross-document i -
dex). If a document has not been preprocessed, 
it is processed, then tested against he query. If 
a document has been preprocessed, the results of 
preprocessing are loaded, and tested against the 
query. Preprocessing produces a worthwhile in- 
crease in speed. Loading the preprocessed files 
ready for constraint satisfaction takes (on aver- 
age) less than a tenth of the time it takes to pro- 
cess the files to get to the same stage. However, 
preprocessed files do take around 60 times more 
filespace than the source files from which they are 
derived 2. 
Although loading a preprocessed file is much 
faster than processing from scratch, the loading 
is still a significant factor in the total processing 
time. In fact for simple queries the loading ac- 
counts for over 90% of processing time. We were 
therefore keen to load only those files where there 
was a chance of success for a query. One way to 
do this is to split the query into an IR and an 
IE component and to use IR to pre filter the set 
of documents. If we only have to load one tenth 
of the documents then again we can expect a 10 
times speed up (assuming the time to do IR is 
relatively trivial relative to the time as a whole). 
A simple way to achieve IR filtering is to extract 
out any non-optional keywords from the query, 
and then only process those documents that con- 
tain the keywords. However, many of the queries 
which we use do not contain keywords at all, only 
sorts. In these cases, we cannot run IR over the 
source documents, since these do not contain the 
sortal information. Instead we search over a sum- 
mary file which is created during preprocessing. 
This contains a set of all the sorts and words found 
in the file. The II:t stage consists of selecting just 
those files which match the sorts and keywords 
in the query. This set is then passed to the IE 
component which deals with relational constraints 
such as same sentence, and interactions between 
constraints which have to be calculated on the fly 
such as precedes which are not indexed during pre- 
processing. 
The IrE component satifies the constraints in the 
2This is worse than it need be: we have not yet 
attempted to rationalise the preprocessed files, or use 
encoding schemes to reduce redundancy.

query against he constraints in the preprocessed 
file. The constraint solver tries to satisfy the most 
specific constraints in the query first. Constraints 
are indexed and reverse indexed for efficiency. 
The processing times we currently achieve are 
very good by the standards of Information Ex- 
traction, and are adequate for the applications for 
which we have been using the system. The cur- 
rent approach is similar to that of e.g. Molla and 
Hess (Aliod and Hess, 1999), who first partition 
the index space into separate documents, and use 
the IR component of queries as a filter. 
Table 1 shows the difference in processing times 
on two queries for two different datasets. Times 
for processing each query on each dataset are la- 
belled Old for Highlight with no IR  and no prepro- 
cessed files, New for Highlight with preprocessed 
files and NewIR for Highlight with both an IR  
stage and preprocessed files. 3 
New% and NewIR% give New/Old and 
NewIR/Old respectively. From the table we 
can see that (for these queries) adding the pre- 
processed files reduces total processing time by 
around 75%. Adding the IR stage reduces it by 
a further couple of percent in the case of the FT 
files and by 10% for the WSJ  files. The perfor- 
mance increase on FT  data is less dramatic be- 
cause the data provides more hits (i.e. we extract 
more templates per input file) but note that for 
both datasets these improvements are at the worse 
end of the spectrum: both the WSJ and FT  files 
stand a very good chance of containing both per- 
son and company (the sorts in our test queries) 
and so the IR component will propose a large num- 
ber of each set for IE treatment, and we can also 
expect several hits per file, which tends to slow 
query processing. In other queries, e.g. a search 
for a company name, we would expect things to 
be much quicker as borne out by the results in 
Table 2. 
4 Per fo rmance  
Figures 6, 7 correspond to the queries in Figures 3 
and 4 respectively. Figure 8 is the result of search- 
ing for protein interactions (a more general version 
of the query in Figure 5.) 4 Table 2 contrasts these 
results. FilesIR and FilesIE refer to the number 
3The WSJ dataset consists of 100 Wall Street Jour- 
nal articles, the FT set comes from 60 Financial Times 
documents. Query 1 looks for a person and company 
in the same sentence while Query 2 is for Person, X 
of/at/in Company. All tests were carried out on a 
Sun Ultra 2200 (200MHz, 256Mb RAM) r~mning Sic- 
stus Prolog 3.7.1 under Solaris 7. 
4For space reasons we have only presented a sample 
of our query results. 
of files input to each stage of the system, i.e. the 
query in Figure 6 was run over 500 news articles, 
only one of them was selected by our IR  compo- 
nent and was thus input to the IE component. 
Hits denotes how many of the files passed to IE 
actually had at least one template in them and 
Templates hows how many templates were ex- 
tracted as a result of the query. Time is the total 
time for the query in seconds. 
The query in Figure 6 looks for documents con- 
taining Esso and a location, s Because Esso is 
such a good discriminator in this document set, 
appearing in only one out of 500 documents, the 
IE query only considers one document and the 
whole query succeeds in 0.5sec. 
Figure 7 takes longer than this because 218 of 
500 files contain the common sorts person and 
company. Figure 8 is similar but has the addi- 
tional overhead of around 2/3 of all files having 
hits where Figure 7 has only 1/20. 
Factors affect the total amount of t ime that  a 
query takes include: 
? specificity of the query 
? complexity of the query 
? size of the source file 
? whether or not there is a hit in the file 
With the addition of the IR  stage, the specificity 
of the query has the potential to impact greatly on 
total query time as already seen. Having a hit in 
the file can also significantly affect timings since 
there is no chance of an early failure of constraint 
satisfaction. For example, taking a file from each 
of the queries in Figures 7 and 8 which each take 
270msec to load (i.e. are of the same size) we find 
that the one in which there is no hit takes 10msec 
to process but the one is which there is a hit takes 
6.5sec (of which just l l0msec is spent writ.rag re- 
sults to file.) 
The lessons from these results are not partic- 
ularly surprising: queries should use the most 
specific words and sorts possible to get good 
value from the IR  component. If there are many 
solutions--and remember that this system aims 
to extract specific information rather than a rele- 
vant document or document passagc then there 
will be a time penalty. 
5Because there is no sentential restriction on these 
two items, they do not appear on the same row in 
the output. This is an option available to the user 
which means that in queries of this kind, the output 
is a summary of the "true" output (a cross product of 
each item with each other item) which can obviously 
result in very large output tables.

Table 2: Comparison of query times 
Our expectation is that complex queries which 
also involve a lot of hits are more likely for batch 
mode operation, so the time penalty will not be 
so crucial. One-off queries will tend to be simpler, 
involving searches for less frequent information. 
However, we are also investigating further ways 
to improve processing speed, in particular during 
constraint satisfaction. 
5 Eva luat ion  
We have not yet performed a large-scale valua- 
tion of the user-customisable version of Highlight. 
The earlier version of Highlight was evaluated for 
the task of extracting protein interactions, obtain- 
ing a recall of 55-58% and precision of 77%. For 
this particular task we would not expect he re- 
sults for the new system to differ significantly: the 
underlying engine is the same and we can use the 
interface to generate sets of constraints which are 
equivalent to the previous patterns. For example, 
Figures 5 (above) and 9 show how an old pattern 
can be generated in the new interface. Both look 
for phrases uch as . . .  observed that TAF binds 
TBP, the old pattern places an in teract ion  tag 
around the relevant ext while in the new inter- 
face the user selects which items will be output 
(in this case, the ones which have names rather 
than numbers.) 
For other tasks, there are some factors which 
might affect the relative recall and precision fig- 
ures between the original Highlight system and 
the customisable version. Firstly, the original 
Highlight system can use cascades of pattern 
matching rules to perform 'blocking tactics' i.e. 
one rule fires for the sole purpose of preventing 
another from firing. To achieve a similar ability 
in customisable Highlight we need to introduce a
way of choosing between alternative queries when 
more than one can apply e.g. by always choos- 
ing the most specific. Secondly, the original High- 
light sometimes resorted to external program calls 
which is no longer possible. 
6 Applications 
The system described in this paper is still under 
development but is already being used in pilot 
projects with commercial clients. Areas in which 
it has been deployed include: 
? expertise database: extracting relationships 
between employees and the projects in which 
they are involved from internal company doc- 
uments. The relationships degrade from 
those which represent certain involvement 
(e.g. writing a report) to those that repre- 
sent possible involvement (e.g. mentioned in 
the same sentence). 
? competitor database: extracting information 
about companies from Financial Times doc- 
uments. Here, we were after in particular the 
chairman, chief executive and so on of any 
companies in the texts. Again, sets of rela- 
tionships howed the degree of certainty with 
which a person was related to a company. 
? conference database: extracting information 
such as conference title, location, date and 
cost from conference calls downloaded from 
the web. This task was particularly interest- 
ing because it required the gathering of in- 
formation from a variety of locations in each 
document rather than the more usual single 
sentence. 
In order to test the flexibility of the new system, 
we have also been recoding previous applications 
of the Highlight system.

Like Foothills, TransCanada's Polar Gas

from the Mackenzie River delta in Canada's

7 Summary  
This paper has given a brief outline of a sys- 
tem which may be used for one-off queries in 
the style of current Information Retrieval systems 
but with the advantages of Information Extrac- 
tion technology. The same interface can be used 
to build queries" appropriate for more traditional 
batch mode Information Extraction tasks.
