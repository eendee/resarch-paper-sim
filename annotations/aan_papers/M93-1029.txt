This broad topic session covered a range of ideas on challenges for the future, along with approaches t o
meeting these challenges . Although some discussion of matters of scale was common to all the presentations ,
the speakers offered different perspectives on how to achieve scale-up .
Two of the presentations, "A Unified View of Different Understanding Tasks" by Dckang Lin, and "Ap-
plications of Extraction Technology: Today and Tomorrow " by Christine Montgomery, focused on linguisti c
principles and processing as ways of meeting future challenges . Lin emphasized that a unifying theoretica l
framework for understanding could lead to "graceful degradation " , helping systems to produce better results .
Montgomery, while covering a number of practical applications of data extraction, stressed that there ar e
many areas in which systems still perform poorly .
Robert Gaizauskas' talk "Applications of Text Extraction in Police Command and Control Systems :
From POETIC to GENIE" presented the "ideal " , generic information extraction system as an extension o f
a current message interpretation framework, which is robust but handles only limited messages in limite d
domains .
My own view, "Making Knowledge Acquisition Work" questioned the incremental approach to extendin g
data extraction systems, claiming that what systems need to make further leaps is not more of what the y
have now but more of what they don't have . For example, lexical acquisition work has focused on learnin g
features of words that are usually found in computational lexicons, while scaling up seems to emphasiz e
world knowledge and discourse-level knowledge, which exist only in very limited forms today .
John Burger's presentation, "Information Extraction and Text Enrichment" emphasized progress throug h
the integration of data extraction with other technologies and standards rather than the development of ne w
methods . Burger stressed the importance of the SGML standard for document markup, explaining ho w
data extraction and document enrichment work together, creating structured texts, hypertext, and servin g
a text database. In addition to showing how data extraction could help in a document management system ,
Burger pointed out that conforming to standards makes it easy to use off-the-shelf tools instead of developin g
custom research software for many functions .
While there are certain areas of agreement about what systems currently can do and what they can ' t ,
do, the differences among these brief talks shows some variation in opinion, not only about which problem s
are most crucial, but also about how to address them . In the discussions at MUC, there were substantia l
disputes among participants even about whether more progress is likely in the near future, and whether tha t
progress will come from more research, as most of the presenters in this session suggested, or from "fin e
tuning" and engineering . It seems that the only way to find out is to continue with task-oriented evaluation s
like MUC, but the rate of progress that has been made in the MUC series does not seem to be slowing .
Hence the reading for the future may be "we will do better"?the open questions are how we will do better ,
and how much better we will do .
