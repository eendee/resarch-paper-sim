Abstract
In this paper, we extend distant supervision
(DS) based on Wikipedia for Relation Extrac-
tion (RE) by considering (i) relations defined
in external repositories, e.g. YAGO, and (ii)
any subset of Wikipedia documents. We show
that training data constituted by sentences
containing pairs of named entities in target re-
lations is enough to produce reliable supervi-
sion. Our experiments with state-of-the-art re-
lation extraction models, trained on the above
data, show a meaningful F1 of 74.29% on a
manually annotated test set: this highly im-
proves the state-of-art in RE using DS. Addi-
tionally, our end-to-end experiments demon-
strated that our extractors can be applied to
any general text document.
1 Introduction
Relation Extraction (RE) from text as defined in
ACE (Doddington et al, 2004) concerns the extrac-
tion of relationships between two entities. This is
typically carried out by applying supervised learn-
ing, e.g. (Zelenko et al, 2002; Culotta and Sorensen,
2004; Bunescu and Mooney, 2005) by using a hand-
labeled corpus. Although, the resulting models are
far more accurate than unsupervised approaches,
they suffer from the following drawbacks: (i) they
require labeled data, which is usually costly to pro-
duce; (ii) they are typically domain-dependent as
different domains involve different relations; and
(iii), even in case the relations do not change, they
result biased toward the text feature distributions of
the training domain.
The drawbacks above would be alleviated if data
from several different domains and relationships
were available. A form of weakly supervision,
specifically named distant supervision (DS) when
applied to Wikipedia, e.g. (Banko et al, 2007; Mintz
et al, 2009; Hoffmann et al, 2010) has been recently
developed to meet the requirement above. The main
idea is to exploit (i) relation repositories, e.g. the
Infobox, x, of Wikipedia to define a set of relation
types RT (x) and (ii) the text in the page associated
with x to produce the training sentences, which are
supposed to express instances of RT (x).
Previous work has shown that selecting the sen-
tences containing the entities targeted by a given re-
lation is enough accurate (Banko et al, 2007; Mintz
et al, 2009) to provide reliable training data. How-
ever, only (Hoffmann et al, 2010) used DS to de-
fine extractors that are supposed to detect all the re-
lation instances from a given input text. This is a
harder test for the applicability of DS but, at the
same time, the resulting extractor is very valuable:
it can find rare relation instances that might be ex-
pressed in only one document. For example, the re-
lation President(Barrack Obama, United States) can
be extracted from thousands of documents thus there
is a large chance of acquiring it. In contrast, Pres-
ident(Eneko Agirre, SIGLEX) is probably expressed
in very few documents, increasing the complexity
for obtaining it.
In this paper, we extend DS by (i) considering
relations from semantic repositories different from
Wikipedia, i.e. YAGO, and (2) using training in-
stances derived from any Wikipedia document. This
allows for (i) potentially obtaining training data
277
for many more relation types, defined in different
sources; (ii) meaningfully enlarging the size of the
DS data since the relation examples can be extracted
from any Wikipedia document 1.
Additionally, by following previous work, we
define state-of-the-art RE models based on kernel
methods (KM) applied to syntactic/semantic struc-
tures. We use tree and sequence kernels that can
exploit structural information and interdependencies
among labels. Experiments show that our models
are flexible and robust to Web documents as we
achieve the interesting F1 of 74.29% on 52 YAGO
relations. This is even more appreciable if we ap-
proximately compare with the previous result on RE
using DS, i.e. 61% (Hoffmann et al, 2010). Al-
though the experiment setting is different from ours,
the improvement of about 13 absolute percent points
demonstrates the quality of our model.
Finally, we also provide a system for extracting
relations from any text. This required the definition
of a robust Named Entity Recognizer (NER), which
is also trained on weakly supervised Wikipedia data.
Consequently, our end-to-end RE system is appli-
cable to any document. This is another major im-
provement on previous work. The satisfactory RE
F1 of 67% for 52 Wikipedia relations suggests that
our model is also successfully applicable in real sce-
narios.
1.1 Related Work
RE generally relates to the extraction of relational
facts, or world knowledge from the Web (Yates,
2009). To identify semantic relations using ma-
chine learning, three learning settings have been ap-
plied, namely supervised methods, e.g. (Zelenko
et al, 2002; Culotta and Sorensen, 2004; Kamb-
hatla, 2004), semi supervised methods, e.g. (Brin,
1998; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000), and unsuper-
vised method, e.g. (Hasegawa et al, 2004; Banko
et al, 2007). Work on supervised Relation Extrac-
tion has mostly employed kernel-based approaches,
e.g. (Zelenko et al, 2002; Culotta and Sorensen,
2004; Culotta and Sorensen, 2004; Bunescu and
Mooney, 2005; Zhang et al, 2005; Bunescu, 2007;
Nguyen et al, 2009; Zhang et al, 2006). However,
1Previous work assumes the page related to the Infobox as
the only source for the training data.

such approaches can be applied to few relation types
thus distant supervised learning (Mintz et al, 2009)
was introduced to tackle such problem. Another so-
lution proposed in (Riedel et al, 2010) was to adapt
models trained in one domain to other text domains.
2 Resources and Dataset Creation
In this section, we describe the resources for the cre-
ation of an annotated dataset based on distant super-
vision. We use YAGO, a large knowledge base of
entities and relations, and Freebase, a collection of
Wikipedia articles. Our procedure uses entities and
facts from YAGO to provide relation instances. For
each pair of entities that appears in some YAGO re-
lation, we retrieve all the sentences of the Freebase
documents that contain such entities.
2.1 YAGO
YAGO (Suchanek et al, 2007) is a huge seman-
tic knowledge base derived from WordNet and
Wikipedia. It comprises more than 2 million entities
(like persons, organizations, cities, etc.) and 20 mil-
lion facts connecting these entities. These include
the taxonomic Is-A hierarchy as well as semantic re-
lations between entities.
We use the YAGO version of 2008-w40-2 with a
manually confirmed accuracy of 95% for 99 rela-
tions. However, some of them are (a) trivial, e.g.
familyNameOf ; (b) numerical attributes that change
over time, e.g. hasPopulation; (c) symmetric, e.g.
hasPredecessor; (d) used only for data management,
e.g. describes or foundIn. Therefore, we removed
those irrelevant relations and obtained 1,489,156 in-
stances of 52 relation types to be used with our DS
approach.
278
2.2 Freebase
To access to Wikipedia documents, we used Free-
base (March 27, 2010 (Metaweb Technologies,
2010)), which is a dump of the full text of all
Wikipedia articles. For our experiments, we used
100,000 articles. Out of them, only 28,074 articles
contain at least one relation for a total of 68,429 of
relation instances. These connect 744,060 entities,
97,828 dates and 203,981 numerical attributes.
Temporal and Numerical Expression
Wikipedia articles are marked with entities like Per-
son or Organization but not with dates or numeri-
cal attributes. This prevents to extract interesting
relations between entities and dates, e.g. John F.
Kennedy was born on May 29, 1917 or between en-
tities and numerical attributes, e.g. The novel Gone
with the wind has 1037 pages. Thus we designed
18 regular expressions to extract dates and other 25
to extract numerical attributes, which range from in-
teger number to ordinal number, percentage, mone-
tary, speed, height, weight, area, time, and ISBN.
2.3 Distant Supervision and generalization
Distant supervision (DS) for RE is based on the
following assumption: (i) a sentence is connected
in some way to a database of relations and (ii)
such sentence contains the pair of entities partic-
ipating in a target relation; (iii) then it is likely
that such sentence expresses the relation. In tra-
ditional DS the point (i) is implemented by the
Infobox, which is connected to the sentences by
a proximity relation (same page of the sentence).
In our extended DS, we relax (i) by allowing
for the use of an external DB of relations such
as YAGO and any document of Freebase (a col-
lection of Wikipedia documents). The alignment
between YAGO and Freebase is implemented by
the Wikipedia page link: for example the link
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James Cameron refers
to the entity James Cameron.
We use an efficient procedure formally described
in Alg. 2.1: for each Wikipedia article in Free-
base, we scan all of its NEs. Then, for each pair
of entities2 seen in the sentence, we query YAGO to
2Our algorithm is robust to the lack of knowledge about the
existence of any relation between two entities. If the relation
retrieve the relation instance connecting these enti-
ties. Note that a simplified version of our approach
is the following: for any YAGO relation instance,
scan all the sentences of all Wikipedia articles to test
point (ii). Unfortunately, this procedure is impossi-
ble in practice due to millions of relation instances
in YAGO and millions of Wikipedia articles in Free-
base, i.e. an order of magnitude of 1014 iterations3.
3 Distant Supervised Learning with
Kernels
We model relation extraction (RE) using state-of-
the-art classifiers based on kernel methods. The
main idea is that syntactic/semantic structures are
used to represent relation instances. We followed the
model in (Nguyen et al, 2009) that has shown sig-
nificant improvement on the state-of-the-art. This
combines a syntactic tree kernel and a polynomial
kernel over feature extracted from the entities:
CK1 = ? ?KP + (1? ?) ? TK (1)
where ? is a coefficient to give more or less impact
to the polynomial kernel,KP , and TK is the syntac-
tic tree kernel (Collins and Duffy, 2001). The best
model combines the advantages of the two parsing
paradigms by adding the kernel above with six se-
quence kernels (described in (Nguyen et al, 2009)).
CSK = ? ?KP +(1??) ?(TK+
?
i=1,..,6
SKi) (2)
Such kernels cannot be applied to Wikipedia doc-
uments as the entity category, e.g. Person or Orga-
nization, is in general missing. Thus, we adapted
them by simply removing the category label in the
nodes of the trees and in the sequences. This data
transformation corresponds to different kernels (see
(Cristianini and Shawe-Taylor, 2000)).
4 Experiments
We carried out test to demonstrate that our DS ap-
proach produces reliable and practically usable re-
lation extractors. For this purpose, we test them on
instance is not in YAGO, it is simply assumed as a negative
instance even if such relation is present in other DBs.

tion. This requires to experiment with a state-of-the-
art Named Entity Recognizer trained on Wikipedia

4.1 Experimental setting
We used the DS dataset generated from YAGO and
Wikipedia articles, as described in the algorithm
(Alg. 2.1). The candidate relations are generated
by iterating all pairs of entity mentions in the same
sentence. Relation detection is formulated as a mul-
ticlass classification problem. The One vs. Rest
strategy is employed by selecting the instance with
largest margin as the final answer. We carried out
5-fold cross-validation with the tree kernel toolkit4
(Moschitti, 2004; Moschitti, 2008).
4.2 Results on Wikipedia RE
We created a test set by sampling 200 articles from
Freebase (these articles are not used for training).
An expert annotator, for each sentence, labeled all
possible pairs of entities with one of the 52 rela-
tions from YAGO, where the entities were already
marked. This process resulted in 2,601 relation in-
stances.
Table 1 shows the performance of individual clas-
sifiers as well as the overall Micro-average F1 for
our adapted CSK: we note that it reaches an F1-
score of 74.29%. This can be compared with the
Micro-average F1 of CK1, i.e. 71.21%. The lower
result suggests that the combination of dependency
and constituent syntactic structures is very impor-
tant: +3.08 absolute percent points on CK1, which
only uses constituency trees.

4.3 End-to-end Relation Extraction
Previous work in RE uses gold entities available in
the annotated corpus (i.e. ACE) but in real appli-
cations these are not available. Therefore, we per-
form experiments with automatic entities. For their
extraction, we follow the feature design in (Nguyen
et al, 2010), using CRF++ 5 with unigram/features
and Freebase as learning source. Dates and numer-
ical attributes required a different treatment, so we
use the patterns described in Section 2.3. The results
reported in Table 2 are rather lower than in standard
NE recognition. This is due to the high complexity
of predicting the boundaries of thousands of differ-
ent categories in YAGO.
Our end-to-end RE system can be applied to any
text fragment so we could experiment with it and
any Wikipedia document. This allowed us to carry
out an accurate evaluation. The results are shown in
Table 2. We note that, without gold entities, RE from
Wikipedia still achieves a satisfactory performance
of 67.00% F1.
5 Conclusion
This paper proposes two main contributions to Re-
lation Extraction: (i) a new approach to distant su-
pervision (DS) to create training data using relations
defined in different sources, i.e. YAGO, and poten-
tially using any Wikipedia document; and (ii) end-
to-end systems applicable both to Wikipedia pages
as well as to any natural language text.
The results show:
1. A high F1 of 74.29% on extracting 52 YAGO
relations from any Wikipedia document (not
only from Infobox related pages). This re-
sult improves on previous work by 13.29 abso-
lute percent points (approximated comparison).
This is a rough approximation since on one
hand, (Hoffmann et al, 2010) experimented
5http://crfpp.sourceforge.net
280
with 5,025 relations, which indicate that our re-
sults based on 52 relations cannot be compared
with it (i.e. our multi-classifier has two orders
of magnitude less of categories). On the other
hand, the only experiment that can give a re-
alistic measurement is the one on hand-labeled
test set (testing on data automatically labelled
by DS does not provide a realistic outcome).
The size of such test set is comparable with
ours, i.e. 100 documents vs. our set of 200
documents. Although, we do not know how
many types of relations were involved in the
test of (Hoffmann et al, 2010), it is clear that
only a small subset of the 5000 relations could
have been measured. Also, we have to consider
that, in (Hoffmann et al, 2010), only one rela-
tion extractor is supposed to be learnt from one
article (by using Infobox) whereas we can po-
tentially extract several relations even from the
same sentence.
2. The importance of using both dependency and
constituent structures (+3.08% when adding
dependency information to RE based on con-
stituent trees).
3. Our end-to-end system is useful for real appli-
cations as it shows a meaningful accuracy, i.e.
67% on 52 relations.
For this reason, we decided to make available the
DS dataset, the manually annotated test set and the
computational data (tree and sequential structures
with labels).
